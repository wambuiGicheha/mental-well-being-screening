This project’s goal is to leverage data science to better understand and detect depressive expressions in online platforms, potentially paving the way for more proactive mental health support. Given the widespread use of platforms like Reddit, this research could benefit individuals by increasing awareness and intervention opportunities"

    "\n",
    "**subreddit** : The subreddit where each post was made, with posts from *\"Depression\"* and *\"SuicideWatch\"* labeled as 1 for depression and posts from other subreddits labeled as 0 (non-depression).\n",

    "**title**: The title of the Reddit post.\n",
    "\n",
    "**body**: The full text of the Reddit post, which may contain valuable information for understanding the context, tone, and possible indicators of depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**upvotes**: Number of upvotes each post received, which may indicate the post's visibility or resonance with the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**created_utc**: The timestamp of when the post was created in UTC, which can help in analyzing temporal trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**num_comments**: The number of comments on each post, which could provide insights into community engagement.\n",

    "**label**: The target variable indicating depression (1) or non-depression (0) based on subreddit.\n",

    "Since the data is already collected from Reddit, with over 6 million rows, further data acquisition may not be necessary. Infact, the team proposes reducing the dataset to about 500,000 rows for the purpose of this project(and to save our laptops). However, if additional data is needed, we could plan to scrape Reddit for more recent posts using a tool that we could identify through further research, provided we comply with Reddit's data collection policies and privacy standards.\n"
